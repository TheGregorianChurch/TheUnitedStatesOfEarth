The monetary system will use blockchain technology and digital devices. Banks, coins, and paper money will no longer be necessary because of the adoption of a distributed ledger on a webapp. Money will be created and given directly to citizens. No debt or securities are purchased when money is created. The newly created money is given directly to the poorest people who then spend it. The money will flow up from the poor to the rich in this system, instead of money flowing to the richest people directly from Central Banks. Everyone in every nation on Earth will exchange their old money for the new United Currency of Earth.
